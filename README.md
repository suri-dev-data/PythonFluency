🧠 Python Fluency Practice – Personal Exercise Repository
This repository contains a collection of Python exercises I've created and solved as part of my journey to improve fluency in the language. These are not tutorials or assignments for others, but rather a personal archive of challenges, experiments, and code snippets that helped me sharpen my skills and deepen my understanding of Python.

🛠️ What's Inside:
Self-made exercises covering various topics like logic, data structures, file I/O, OOP, and more

My own solutions, sometimes with comments or alternative approaches

Work-in-progress scripts and unfinished ideas — because learning is messy and nonlinear

Notes and reflections on what I learned or struggled with in each section
